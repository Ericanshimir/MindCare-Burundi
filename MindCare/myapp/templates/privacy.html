    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Your privacy matters. MindCare Burundi is committed to protecting your personal data and ensuring transparency in how we collect, use, and store information.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not collect sensitive personal data unless you explicitly provide it. Any data submitted is anonymized and used only for service improvement and usage analytics.</p>

    <h2>2. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>All anonymous chats are encrypted and stored temporarily for quality assurance. Only authorized mental health professionals can access relevant data — and only in cases where support is requested. Users are never identified unless they choose to share identifying details.</p>

    <h2>3. User Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You have the right to request the deletion of your chat history and any stored information.</li>
        <li>You can opt out of non-essential communications at any time.</li>
        <li>Requests can be made through your account settings or by contacting support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Copyright and Ownership</h2>
    <p>All content is either original, licensed, or cited. It is protected under intellectual property laws. Users may not reproduce or reuse any materials without permission.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Transparency</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties. There are no hidden trackers or deceptive designs. Any cookies or analytics used are disclosed clearly.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We use encryption and security best practices to ensure your data is protected. However, no system is entirely immune to breaches — use caution when sharing information online.</p>

    <p>For questions about this policy or to request your data, please contact our support team directly.</p>
